**FRONTEND DEVELOPER** SELF-EMPLOYED

I am actively engaged in enhancing my coding proficiency, with a specific focus on mastering Next.js and React.js.Through a multi-faceted approach, I utilize online platforms like Udemy to invest in paid courses tailored to my learning objectives.

Additionally, I avidly seek out free online resources across various platforms to complement my studies. From scouring through coding books to diligently completing exercises, I adopt a comprehensive self-study regimen. Moreover, I allocate time for personal projects, applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, thereby reinforcing my understanding.
