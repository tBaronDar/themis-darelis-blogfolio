## ABOUT ME

With over 15 years of experience as an electrical engineer, including 7 years abroad in Belgium, I transitioned careers to
pursue my passion for web development. Currently honing my skills in React.js and Next.js, I thrive on learning and
eagerly seek opportunities to demonstrate my capabilities.
