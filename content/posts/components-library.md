## A library of web components.

The most time consuming part of making a web app, I find, is to create complex components that are similar from app to app. For example a _pagination_ component is more or less the same in most cases.

After finishing a course on web design I decided to create a website full of complex components. Inorder to use them in the future as inspiration/reference and of course as practice. I believe it is best to practice with these components in a vacuum in order to experiment freely and then use the results of the experiments as scaffolds.
