## New Components.

- Table(html)
- Pagination
- Top navigation bar(minimal)

---

## Section Components.

Though the top navigation bar the user can browse _Section_ _Components_. Components too big to co-exist in the same page as the other ones. When the link is clicked it opens a new tab("_blank_") with the selected item, because I didn't want to add addition buttons/link for the necessary navigation. This way I think, the components remain clean and can be copied more easily. The first component of this type:

- Hero component(image background/text in center)

---

## Small screen check.

I added a check when the page loads to make sure that the user understands that these components are designed with large screens in mind.
