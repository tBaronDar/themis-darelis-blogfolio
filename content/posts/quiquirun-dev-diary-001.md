## New features.

- Added end state, when player collects all pickups.
- Added main menu with 3 options.

## Music and sound effects

It is adviced to use **Google Chrome** when playing from a mobile device. Other browsers may cause the music to stutter. I converted the tracks from _.mp3_ to _.ogg_, this shrank down the total size of the game but it didn't fix the stuttering on the default **Samsung** internet browser.

The credits for the music go to **WELC0MEÐ˜0** for creating the track.

## Score and End state.

Each time the player collects a pickup they _emit_ a _signal_ and the **UI** updates the _score label_. When the player reaches a certain score time _time scale_ of the engine is set to 0, pausing the game, and a menu pops up, giving the player the options to restart or quit the game.

---

## Main Menu

The menu contains three options:

- Resume
- Restart
- Exit

_Resume_ closes the menu, _Restart_ restarts the level, and _Exit_ exits the game. _Exit_ doesn't work on **itch.io** because the game is upload as webapp(HTML5). It works normaly on the windows exe.
