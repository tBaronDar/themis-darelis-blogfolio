# Situation Update.

I wanted to inform whoever reads these, that project updates will be published less frequently over the next few weeks. I am currently searching for a new apartment, which will take up a significant portion of my time. Additionally, I will be occupied with the moving process once I secure a new place. Furthermore, I will be on vacation during the second half of August. I plan spending most of my time appling for jobs and **reflecting** on what my next project will be.
